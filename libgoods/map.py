"""
placeholder / mockup for libgoods

For the moment, this is where we will define the interaction between the
webgnome_api and libgoods.


Notes:

we may want to be smarter about how to handle big files.
 - Perhaps the API could take a path to write to, so it can
   write data bit by bit, and do checks for file size, etc

Do we want to have a bounding boax as a single item?
 - either a special class -- we have one in py_gnome,
 - or a tuple of tuples.

Alternativly, use a polygon for bounds
 -- it could happen to be a rectangle, or not.

We should use the requests package if we have to do much
querying of other systems
