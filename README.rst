libGOODS / Model Catalogs
=========================

Python packages for retrieving environmental data needed for running GNOME model (shorelines, currents, winds)


libgoods
--------

A library that serves and an easy API to model_catalogs -- it is used behind the NOAA WebGNOME system, and can be used to easily access model results as netcdf files.


**NOTE:**

These packages are under active development -- their API will change.

Contributions are welcome, but we encourage you to work with the develop branch, and make sure to always pull the latest version before making any bug reports, comments or pull requests.
